# Installing and Using the Nodejs-Dashboard

## This repo follows along with the egghead.io lessons on using the [Nodejs-Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/nodejs-dashboard). Please select the appropriate branch for the lesson you are watching.

### [Installing nodejs-dashboard](https://github.com/rekibnikufesin/nodejs-dashboard-examples/tree/installing-nodejs-dashboard)
Covers installation and basic operation of the dashboard.

### [Using jmeter to affect the event loop timer](https://github.com/rekibnikufesin/nodejs-dashboard-examples/tree/event-loop-timer)
This lesson focuses on some poorly written code with heavy I/O. We use jmeter to drive the load up and use the nodejs-dashboard event loop timer to diagnose the problem.

### [Monitoring memory leaks](https://github.com/rekibnikufesin/nodejs-dashboard-examples/tree/monitor-memory-leaks)
This lesson uses a memory leak to observe the memory usage panel in nodejs-dashboard, then demonstrates configuring garbage collection to log to the stderr console, allowing us to visually associate garbage collection attempts with the increasing memory utilization.
